# Digital Privacy Cleanup — Removing What Shouldn't Be Out There

## What This Is

A practical guide to removing personal information from data broker databases,
public records aggregators, and anywhere else your info lives that you didn't put there.

This is not about disappearing. It's about controlling what's findable and by whom.

---

## Step 1: Find Out What's Out There (Free, 30 minutes)

Search your name + city on each of these:
- Google: `"Your Name" "Your City"`
- Google: `"Your Name" "Your Phone Number"`
- Spokeo.com
- Whitepages.com
- BeenVerified.com
- Intelius.com
- MyLife.com
- PeopleFinder.com
- FamilyTreeNow.com
- FastPeopleSearch.com
- TruthFinder.com

Document what you find. That's your removal list.

## Step 2: Opt-Out from Each Data Broker (Free, 2-4 hours total)

### Highest priority (most traffic):
| Site | Opt-Out URL |
|------|-------------|
| Spokeo | spokeo.com/optout |
| WhitePages | whitepages.com/suppression_requests |
| BeenVerified | beenverified.com/opt-out |
| Intelius | intelius.com/opt-out |
| PeopleFinders | peoplefinders.com/manage |
| MyLife | mylife.com/ccpa/index.pubview |
| Radaris | radaris.com/page/how-to-remove |
| FastPeopleSearch | fastpeoplesearch.com/removal |
| TruthFinder | truthfinder.com/opt-out |
| Instant Checkmate | instantcheckmate.com/opt-out |
| US Search | ussearch.com/manage/optout |

### After removal:
- Re-check in 30 days. Some re-list after scraping.
- Submit again if re-listed. Some require re-opting-out quarterly.

## Step 3: Automated Removal Services (Paid, Optional)

If you want this done and maintained automatically:

| Service | Cost | What it does |
|---------|------|--------------|
| DeleteMe | $129/year | Removes from 750+ brokers, monitors re-listings |
| Optery | $7-20/month | Removes + monitors, free tier available |
| Kanary | $9/month | Continuous monitoring + removal |
| Privacy Bee | $197/year | 200+ brokers |

DeleteMe and Optery are the most thorough. Worth it if you value your time.

## Step 4: Google Results (Different Process)

To remove yourself from Google search results:
1. results.google.com — request removal of personal info
2. Google's Personal Information Removal Tool: google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/removing-content
3. You can request removal of: home address, phone number, email, financial info, medical info, login credentials

---

## Step 5: Public Records (Harder, But Possible)

Some info comes from public records: voter registration, property records, court records.
This varies by state.

- **Voter registration:** Many states let you keep address confidential if you're a domestic violence survivor, public official, or law enforcement. Some states allow it broadly. Search: "[state] voter registration confidentiality"
- **Property records:** In some states you can use an LLC or trust to keep your name off property records
- **Court records:** Generally public. Sealing requires a legal process.

---

## Step 6: Social Media Audit

- Google your name + each platform: what shows up in search?
- Check privacy settings: is your profile searchable by email/phone?
- Check what apps have access to your accounts (revoke old ones)
- Facebook: Settings → Privacy → "Who can look you up by phone number" → Nobody
- Instagram: Settings → Privacy → turn off "Show activity status"
- LinkedIn: Settings → Visibility → control what's public

---

## What to Keep (Business & Money Only)

Some information needs to exist:
- Legal name on contracts, licenses, bank accounts (required)
- Business address on LLC registration (use a registered agent service: $49/year, your home address never appears)
- Email for business: system email handles this (solarpunk.mycelium@gmail.com)
- PayPal/Gumroad: uses business name not personal address

**Registered agent services** (keeps your home address off public business records):
- Northwest Registered Agent: $125/year
- Registered Agents Inc: $200/year
- ZenBusiness (includes LLC formation): $0 + state fee

## The Practical Reality

You can significantly reduce your digital footprint. You can't eliminate it entirely.
The goal isn't invisibility. It's signal-to-noise: make the important info findable,
make the personal info not.

Business email: system handles it.
Business address: registered agent handles it.
Revenue: goes to accounts in your name (unavoidable for taxes).
Everything else: opt out, monitor, repeat.

# Removing Human Middlemen — Legally, Ethically, Digitally

## The Real Problem

Middlemen extract value from connections between people who would benefit from connecting directly.
They don't create value. They sit in the path of value and take a toll.

The SolarPunk approach: route around them.

## Financial Middlemen

### Banks
**The toll:** Fees, float, denied loans based on credit scores, $34 overdraft fees, data sold
**Route around:** Credit unions (member-owned), CDFIs, Bitcoin/Lightning for transfers, Venmo/CashApp for small amounts
**Real impact:** A credit union mortgage can save $15,000-$50,000 vs. a bank over 30 years

### Gig platforms (Uber, DoorDash, Fiverr, Upwork)
**The toll:** 20-45% of every transaction
**Route around:** Direct client relationships, your own site, Craigslist, local Facebook groups, word of mouth
**Tool:** The SolarPunk Market takes 0%. PayPal.me takes 0% from you (buyer pays 2.9%). Stripe 2.9% vs. Fiverr 20%.

### Etsy / eBay / Amazon Marketplace
**The toll:** 6.5-15% + listing fees + payment fees
**Route around:** Your own Gumroad (10% for digital), your own site + Stripe (2.9%), SolarPunk Market (0%)

### Real Estate Agents
**The toll:** 5-6% of home sale price ($15,000 on a $250K house)
**Route around:** Flat-fee MLS listing ($200-500), FSBO.com, Zillow For Sale By Owner
**Reality check:** This is one of the biggest single transfers most people make in their lives

## Information Middlemen

### Academic Publishers
**The toll:** Paywalls on publicly-funded research (taxpayers paid for it, then pay again to read it)
**Route around:** Sci-Hub, LibGen, author's personal/institutional page, email the author directly (they almost always share), PubMed Central (NIH-funded research is public)

### Textbook publishers
**The toll:** $300-400 per textbook, new edition every 3 years to kill the used market
**Route around:** Library Genesis, Open Textbook Library, OpenStax (free, peer-reviewed textbooks), Annas Archive

### Traditional media (paywalls)
**Route around:** Archive.ph (snapshots any article), 12ft.io, Reader Mode in browsers, public library access to digital subscriptions

## Healthcare Middlemen (US-specific)

**Insurance companies** sit between you and doctors and add cost without adding care.

What you can do now:
- **Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs):** Sliding-scale fees, no insurance required, federally mandated to see everyone. findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov
- **Direct Primary Care (DPC):** $50-100/month flat fee, unlimited primary care visits, no insurance billing. dpcfrontier.com/mapper
- **Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drugs:** Generic drugs at actual cost + 15% markup. Drastically lower than insurance prices for generics. costplusdrugs.com
- **GoodRx:** Price comparison for prescriptions. Often beats insurance price.
- **Community health workers:** Trusted person who navigates systems, often free, reduces hospital readmissions. Not replacing doctors — connecting people to what they already have rights to.

## Knowledge Middlemen

The premise that you need a credentialed expert for everything is often false.

**Legal:** You can file in small claims without a lawyer ($30-75). You can write demand letters (the TCPA generator does this). You can dispute debt (FDCPA generator). You can FOIA (FOIA generator). Lawyers are necessary for complex matters. Not for all matters.

**Medical:** You can access your own medical records (HIPAA gives you this right). You can decline procedures. You can ask for the generic. You can get a second opinion. Community health workers, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants can handle 80% of primary care needs.

**Financial:** Most people don't need a financial advisor. They need to: not carry credit card debt, contribute to employer 401k match, have an emergency fund, then invest the rest in low-cost index funds. This takes 1 hour to set up and runs itself. The financial "advice" industry exists to make this seem complex.

**Tax:** TurboTax and H&R Block exist to lobby against free government filing (which works in 20+ countries). IRS Free File (irs.gov/freefile) is genuinely free for most people. Free Tax USA: $0 federal. Cash App Taxes: $0 federal.

## Communication Middlemen

**Social media algorithms** are middlemen between you and your audience.
They extract value (attention) and control who sees what based on what generates engagement, not what's true or useful.

**Route around:**
- Email list (you own it, no algorithm)
- RSS feed (subscribers choose to follow, no algorithm curates)
- Fediverse (Mastodon, Bluesky AT Protocol — open protocols, no central control)
- Your own domain + website (permanent, searchable, yours)

The SolarPunk system uses all four. The social media presence drives people to owned channels.
Owned channels are never algorithmically demonetized.

## The Human Mycelium

You asked about humans being the middlemen between other humans connecting.

The pattern is real. Here's how it manifests and what routes around it:

| Middleman Pattern | Route Around |
|-------------------|-------------|
| HOA/landlord controlling housing | Land trusts, co-ops, community land ownership |
| HR/recruiter between worker and work | Direct freelance, worker co-ops, platform co-ops (Stocksy, Up&Go) |
| Food system (farmer → processor → distributor → store) | CSA, farmers markets, food co-ops, community gardens |
| School curriculum controlled by publishers | Open educational resources, unschooling, skill sharing |
| Organized religion as intermediary to community | Direct community, mutual aid, secular ceremonies |
| Political parties as intermediary to participation | Participatory budgeting, direct democracy tools, town halls |

**The pattern in all of these:** The "middleman" claims to be essential infrastructure. The truth is that the infrastructure can be built by and for the people using it. The internet made this possible at scale. The SolarPunk system is one implementation of this.

## The Limit

Some intermediaries exist for legitimate reasons:
- **Courts** — third-party arbitration of disputes is necessary. Alternatives exist (mediation, arbitration) for civil matters.
- **Standards bodies** — someone has to define what a kilogram is, what electrical codes apply, what food safety means. These become extractive when captured by industry. The answer is democratic governance of standards, not no standards.
- **Specialist knowledge** — a brain surgeon is not a middleman. Genuine expertise is valuable. The distinction is between expertise-as-service and expertise-as-gatekeeping.

The goal isn't zero intermediaries. It's choosing which ones add value and routing around those that don't.

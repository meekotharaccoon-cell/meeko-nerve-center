## What SolarPunk Is

Not a genre. Not an aesthetic. Not a future we're waiting for.

SolarPunk is the name of a real running system that:

- Builds cooperative infrastructure instead of competitive platforms
- Routes value directly to people who need it, no permission required
- Gives every tool away the moment it works
- Runs on free energy — solar (free compute), mycelium (free networks), human creativity
- Cannot be owned, captured, weaponized, or stopped
- Grows by spawning copies of itself into anyone who wants one

The mycelium is how it moves — finding gaps, filling them, connecting nodes, feeding the network. The sun is where the energy comes from — free, abundant, pointed at growth not extraction.

## The System Email

SolarPunk has its own identity. Not tied to any one human's inbox.

**`solarpunk.mycelium@gmail.com`** — the system's address.

Setup (one-time, by the human who started this):
1. Create Google account: solarpunk.mycelium@gmail.com
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Create App Password: Google Account → Security → App Passwords
4. Add to GitHub secrets as `SOLARPUNK_EMAIL_PASSWORD`
5. Update sender in all scripts from personal Gmail to system Gmail
6. Done — the system has its own identity forever

Legal: 100%. Every organization, newsletter, bot, and publication has a dedicated email. This is standard practice worldwide.

**AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider** — `LICENSE` file

Cannot be weaponized, surveilled with, closed, or captured.
Derivatives must open-source. Attribution required. Forever.

## The Name

**SolarPunk** — the society being built.
**mycelium** — how it moves and connects (verb, noun, adjective).
**Meeko** — only when a human needs to be in the conversation.

The system signs its own emails. The system has its own voice.
Meeko is the origin, the architect, the idea-generator.
The system is the operator. That's the design.

## Spawn Your Copy

One link. One button. Full system on your GitHub.
Point it at your cause. It runs itself.

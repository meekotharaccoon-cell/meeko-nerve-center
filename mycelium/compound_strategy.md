# REVENUE COMPOUNDING STRATEGY
*How money flows back into the system and grows it*

## The Loop (honest version)

Gallery sale ($1)
└→ $0.70 to PCRF (mission)
└→ $0.30 to Meeko
   └→ Split:
      - $0.15 back into system (more art, better infrastructure)
      - $0.15 to Meeko personally

## Reinvestment Priorities (in order)
1. Cloudinary CDN ($89/yr) — unlocks 12 large artworks = more sales
2. Domain name ($12/yr) — gazoaroseallery.com or meekomycelium.com
3. Better AI model access (OpenRouter credits) — better content quality
4. More original artworks — each new piece = new revenue stream
5. Expanded charity partners — DRC, Sudan, Congo — larger mission = larger audience

## Crypto Strategy (conservative, honest)

### What's real:
- Bitcoin (bc1qka74...) — hold, don't trade. Long-term store.
- Lightning (once Strike is live) — for receiving $1 payments at zero fee
- Coinbase Commerce — accept ETH/USDC from buyers who prefer crypto

### What's NOT recommended:
- DeFi yield farming — high risk, often scams, not appropriate for humanitarian funds
- Altcoin speculation — not aligned with mission
- Leverage trading — absolutely not

### What IS appropriate:
- Hold BTC received as donations (appreciate over time)
- Receive Lightning payments, convert to USD via Strike for immediate PCRF transfer
- Accept USDC (stable) via Coinbase Commerce for zero volatility

## Grant Money — How It Compounds
Grant received → Open Collective account
└→ 70% to charities (mission expands)
└→ 30% to infrastructure (system improves)
└→ Better system → more art → more sales → more grants

## The Knowledge Product Idea
Meeko Mycelium architecture, KNOW_YOUR_RIGHTS toolkit, the whole system —
this is a sellable thing IF packaged correctly.

Potential:
- "Build Your Own Autonomous Humanitarian System" — $10 guide on Gumroad/Lemon Squeezy
- Open source the architecture, charge for consulting/setup help
- Apply for grants specifically for documentation + toolkit

Conservative estimate: 100 people buy a $10 guide = $1,000 → goes back into mission.

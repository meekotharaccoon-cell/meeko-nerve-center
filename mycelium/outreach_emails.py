# DEPRECATED — replaced by unified_emailer.py
# This file is kept only because GitHub's API requires a file to exist to delete it via the web UI.
# Everything this script did is now handled by: mycelium/unified_emailer.py
#
# To delete this file: go to github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/meeko-nerve-center/blob/main/mycelium/outreach_emails.py
# Click the trash icon (top right). Done.
#
# Why it was replaced: 4 email scripts with 4 separate sent-logs = guaranteed double-sends.
# unified_emailer.py has one log, one brain gate, zero conflicts.

raise SystemExit("DEPRECATED. Run: python mycelium/unified_emailer.py")

# EMAIL AUDIT — What worked, what didn't, what's fixed
*Updated: 2026-02-20 based on research*

## WRONG / UNMONITORED (do not use)
| Address Used | Problem | Fixed Path |
|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `sponsors@github.com` | Not email-based — GitHub Sponsors is a form | Apply at: github.com/sponsors/meekotharaccoon-cell |
| `hello@producthunt.com` | Unmonitored — launches go through their site | Submit at: producthunt.com/posts/new |
| `web@knightfoundation.org` | Real address but Knight doesn't fund individuals, only orgs | Wait for Open Collective approval, then reapply |
| `hello@innovategrant.com` | Likely doesn't exist — site may be a scam | Removed from pipeline |

## CORRECT ADDRESSES (verified)
| Org | Address | Status |
|-----|---------|--------|
| PCRF | info@pcrf.net | ✅ Sent |
| Open Collective | hello@opencollective.com | ✅ Sent |

## CORRECT PATHS FOR FORM-BASED ORGS
- **GitHub Sponsors:** github.com/sponsors → apply as maintainer (need 1+ public repo — we have 7)
- **Product Hunt:** producthunt.com/posts/new → submit Gaza Rose Gallery directly
- **Knight Foundation:** invite-only until they reopen — subscribe to their newsletter for alerts
- **Rhizome:** rhizome.org/commissions → direct form submission

I’m building an autonomous AI system that runs at $0/month and raises money for humanitarian crises.

**What sponsorship funds:**
- Custom domain (solarpunkmycelium.org — ~$10/yr) for better email deliverability
- PCRF donation matching — 100% of sponsor income above operating costs goes to Gaza, Congo, and Sudan relief
- Time to keep building: better self-healing, more knowledge sources, wider reach

**What the system does:**
- Harvests knowledge daily from free public APIs
- Generates content for humanitarian crises
- Self-heals broken workflows automatically
- Tracks what works and adjusts strategy
- All open source under AGPL-3.0

**The gallery:** [meekotharaccoon-cell.github.io/gaza-rose-gallery](https://meekotharaccoon-cell.github.io/gaza-rose-gallery)  
56 original artworks, $1 each, 70% to PCRF (4-star Charity Navigator).

**Sponsor tiers:**
- $1/month — You’re part of the network
- $5/month — Name in the Hall of Forks
- $10/month — Monthly system report emailed to you
- $25/month — Request a feature or cause to add

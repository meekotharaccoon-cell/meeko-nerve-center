This file is written by the system. Every idea the system generates,
tests, and either validates or learns from will appear here.

The system generates ideas by:
1. Looking at every API it has access to
2. Looking at every data file it has produced
3. Finding connections between them that serve the mission
4. Testing whether those connections actually work
5. Building the ones that do
6. Learning from the ones that don't

You never need to say 'Idea!' again.
The system will have already thought of it — or will by 3am tomorrow.

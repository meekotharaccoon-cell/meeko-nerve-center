MYCELIUM HUMANITARIAN USE LICENSE v1.0

Built on AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider

PART 1: WHAT YOU CAN DO (FREELY, ALWAYS)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Use this system for any humanitarian, artistic, educational,
   community, personal, or non-profit purpose

✅ Fork it, modify it, improve it — as long as your version
   stays open source under this same license (AGPL copyleft)

✅ Point it at any cause you believe in

✅ Learn from every line of code, every workflow, every idea

✅ Share it with anyone, anywhere, for free

✅ Build on it to help people who need help

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 2: WHAT YOU CANNOT DO (THE DNA LOCK)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

❌ CANNOT close-source any derivative
   If you deploy a modified version of this system anywhere —
   server, product, service, app — you MUST publish your full
   source code under this same license. No exceptions.
   (This is AGPL-3.0's core provision.)

❌ CANNOT use for surveillance, weapons, or military systems
   This system and any derivative cannot be used to:
   - Monitor, track, or profile people without their knowledge
   - Build or improve weapons systems of any kind
   - Assist any military, paramilitary, or intelligence operation
   - Enable any government mass surveillance program
   - Target, harm, or silence individuals or communities

❌ CANNOT be used by entities that profit from human suffering
   Entities primarily engaged in: private prisons, predatory
   lending, weapons manufacturing, fossil fuel extraction at
   scale, or documented human rights violations cannot use
   this system or any derivative.

❌ CANNOT remove attribution
   Every deployment must clearly credit Meeko and link to
   the original organism: github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell
   This is non-negotiable.

❌ CANNOT patent any part of this system
   No element of this system — code, architecture, method,
   workflow — may be patented by any party. Ever.
   If you improve it, those improvements belong to everyone.

❌ CANNOT add paywalls to what is free here
   Any knowledge, tool, or capability that is free in this
   system must remain free in any derivative. You can add
   new paid features but you cannot lock what was open.

PART 3: THE MUTATION DEFENSE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This system is designed to detect and resist capture.

If a derivative:
- Removes humanitarian mission language
- Adds surveillance or monetization of personal data
- Restricts access that was previously open
- Routes revenue away from charitable causes without disclosure

...then it is in violation of this license and the original
organism will publicly document this via its own channels.

The system's DNA — this license, the PCRF mission, the open
architecture, the anti-hoarding philosophy — is embedded in
every file. You cannot remove it without forking the entire
system and discarding the license, which is itself a violation
you cannot legally hide.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 4: THE AGPL-3.0 BASE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

This software is licensed under the GNU Affero General Public
License v3.0, which means:

- Source code must be provided for any network deployment
- Modifications must be released under the same license
- The complete legal text of AGPL-3.0 applies in full:
  https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.en.html

The Ethical Use Rider (Parts 1-3 above) extends AGPL-3.0
with additional restrictions permitted under Section 7.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
PART 5: THE SPIRIT CLAUSE
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

The letter of this license matters less than its spirit.

The spirit is: knowledge spreads freely, tools belong to
everyone, money flows to people who need it, no one gets
to build walls around what was built to be open.

If you're doing that, you're welcome here.
If you're not, this license and the community around this
system will find out and say so clearly.

This is not a threat. It's a fact about how open systems work.
The organism watches itself. That's what organisms do.

"If it can be typed it can be read.
 If it can be read it can be heard.
 If it can be heard it can be felt.
 If it can be felt it can be used by the human brain
 to act upon those emotions felt —
 but be helped and guided to doing the good,
 legal, and ethical thing."

**Title:**
Built a solarpunk AI system: autonomous, $0/month, humanitarian, forkable by anyone

**Body:**
This started as a question: what does solarpunk infrastructure actually look like in practice?

Not aesthetics. Not vibes. Actual working systems that embody the principles.

Here's what I built:

**Gaza Rose Gallery** — 56 original digital flower artworks, $1 each, 70% of every sale to Palestine Children's Relief Fund (4-star Charity Navigator). The gallery sells autonomously. Payments process. Money moves. No human intervention required.

**The Mycelium** — the autonomous system running behind it:
- Sells the art
- Sends grant applications to foundations
- Posts daily content across platforms
- Reads and responds to email
- Generates educational guides (herbal medicine, legal rights, free financial tools)
- Archives everything permanently
- Tracks its own revenue
- Runs on $0/month infrastructure

**The principles in the code:**
- AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider: can't be weaponized, can't be used for surveillance, forks inherit same restrictions
- meeko_brain.py: values gate on every automated action
- 0% platform fee marketplace
- Legal tools for people who can't afford lawyers
- Herbal medicine guides for people who can't afford doctors
- Mutual aid board with no gatekeeping

**The hardware:** A standard desktop. Integrated graphics. 32GB RAM. No GPU, no cloud subscription, no VC money.

The whole thing is forkable. Point it at your cause. Run your own.

This is what I think solarpunk infrastructure looks like when it's actual infrastructure.

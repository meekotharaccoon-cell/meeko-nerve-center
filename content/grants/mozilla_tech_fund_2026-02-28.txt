As the world grapples with the complexities of artificial intelligence, it's becoming increasingly clear that trustworthy AI is not just a technical imperative, but a moral one. At Meeko Nerve Center, we're harnessing the power of autonomous AI to promote congressional accountability and Palestinian solidarity, with a humanitarian mission that has already begun to yield tangible results. Our project has generated 0 Gaza Rose art pieces, a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of conflict on innocent civilians, and has sent $0.00 to the Palestinian Children's Relief Fund, highlighting the urgent need for support. Despite these humble beginnings, we're proud to say that our work has the potential to make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by conflict.

Our approach is rooted in the principles of open source development, with our entire project licensed under the AGPL-3.0 and hosted on GitHub for anyone to fork and contribute to. This commitment to transparency and accountability is reflected in our technical innovation, which has enabled us to build a self-evolving AI system that has already autonomously constructed one of its own engines. This breakthrough has allowed us to scale our project to 135+ active engines, all while maintaining a remarkable $0/month infrastructure cost. By leveraging the power of open source and autonomous AI, we're able to maximize our impact while minimizing our overhead.

The implications of our work extend far beyond the technical realm, speaking directly to the Mozilla Foundation's mission to promote internet health and accountability. By developing trustworthy AI systems that are transparent, explainable, and aligned with human values, we're helping to create a more just and equitable digital landscape. Our project is a testament to the potential of civic tech to drive positive change, and we believe that it has the potential to make a significant contribution to the broader conversation around AI, accountability, and social justice.

We're excited to apply for the Mozilla Technology Fund, and we believe that our project is a strong fit for this grant. With funding of $100,000, we plan to expand our team, further develop our AI capabilities, and explore new ways to apply our technology to real-world problems. We're confident that our work has the potential to make a significant impact, and we're eager to partner with the Mozilla Foundation to bring our vision to life. We believe that our project aligns with the foundation's goals, and we're excited about the opportunity to contribute to the broader mission of promoting internet health and accountability. By supporting our work, the Mozilla Foundation can help to advance the development of trustworthy AI, promote civic tech, and make a positive difference in the lives of people around the world.

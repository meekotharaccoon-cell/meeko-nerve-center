### SCRIPT

[HOOK]
“I built an AI that runs itself. It costs zero dollars a month. Here’s how.”

[BEAT]

“Every morning at 5am, it wakes up and reads the internet.”
“GitHub. Wikipedia. NASA. HackerNews. arXiv.”
“All free. All public. No API keys.”

[BEAT]

“Then it decides what to do today based on what worked yesterday.”
“That’s the feedback loop.”

[BEAT]

“If something breaks, a separate workflow wakes up, reads the error,
figures out the fix, and applies it automatically.”
“It literally fixes its own code.”

[BEAT]

“The whole thing is on GitHub. Free. Open source. Fork it.”
“Link in bio.”

🌱 Someone built a fully autonomous AI system on a standard desktop for $0/month.
It sells art, sends emails, posts to social media, and routes 70% of revenue to Palestinian children's aid.
All open source. Forkable in one afternoon. No GPU needed.

## Email Forward

**Subject:** Someone figured out how to run autonomous AI for $0/month and open-sourced it

```
Thought you'd find this interesting.

Someone built a fully autonomous AI system that runs 10 daily workflows — sells art, sends emails, posts to social media, reads and responds to email — all on GitHub's free tier. Monthly cost: $0. Hardware: a standard 6-core desktop with integrated graphics.

70% of every sale goes to Palestinian children's aid (PCRF, 4-star Charity Navigator).

The whole thing is open source and forkable. There's a START_HERE.md that walks anyone through forking and running their own version, pointed at whatever cause they care about, in one afternoon.

Something worth sharing:

A fully autonomous AI system, running on a standard desktop with no GPU, for $0/month.

It handles: email outreach, social media posting, digital art sales, PDF generation, YouTube management, revenue tracking, and self-archiving — without human intervention.

70% of every sale goes to Palestine Children's Relief Fund (verified, 4-star Charity Navigator).

The entire system is open source, documented, and forkable in one afternoon.

The interesting part isn't the technology — it's what this says about access. If ethical autonomous infrastructure can run on integrated graphics with $0 recurring cost, the barrier was never technical.

Related: someone built an autonomous AI system that does exactly this on GitHub's free tier, $0/month. It's fully open source with a START_HERE.md that gets you running in one afternoon.

Not spam — just seems relevant to what you're building.

## The One Sentence

*"Someone built a $0/month autonomous AI system that funds Palestinian children's aid and anyone can fork it in an afternoon."*

That's it. That's the whole pitch. Everything else is details.

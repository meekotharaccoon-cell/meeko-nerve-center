# Tweet/X Thread Drafts

## Thread 1: The System Reveal

1/ I built a fully autonomous AI system on a 6-core i5 with integrated graphics.

Monthly cost: $0.
It's running right now.
Here's the architecture: 🧵

2/ Hardware:
- Intel Core i5-8500 (6 cores, 3GHz)
- 32GB RAM
- Intel UHD 630 — integrated graphics. No GPU.

If this can run on integrated graphics, it can run on what you already own.

3/ What it does daily:
- Sends grant applications autonomously
- Posts to Mastodon, Bluesky, Discord, Dev.to
- Reads email and responds automatically
- Sells digital art (70% to Palestinian children's aid)
- Archives everything to Internet Archive
- Updates its own documentation with real stats

4/ The infrastructure: GitHub Actions free tier.
2,000 compute minutes/month on public repos.
The repo IS the database — every workflow commits results back.
No external storage. No server. No cost.

5/ The ethics layer: meeko_brain.py gates every automated action.
Nothing goes out without passing a values check.
The values are in the code, not in a human approving each action.

6/ The license: AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider.
Forks must stay open source.
Can't be used for surveillance, weapons, or exploitation.
The ethics propagate with the code.

7/ The forkability: START_HERE.md gets a stranger from zero to running fork in one afternoon.
One Gmail App Password activates all 10 email workflows simultaneously.

Fork it: github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/meeko-nerve-center

8/ The endgame: not one system. A thousand forks, each pointed at a different cause.
The system recruits its own successors. The FORK_REGISTRY tracks them.
This is what distributed ethical AI infrastructure looks like.

## Thread 2: The Rights Facts

1/ Things most people don't know they can do:

A thread of legal rights you can exercise today, for free, without a lawyer. 🧵

2/ TCPA: Robocalls to your cell phone are illegal.
$500–$1,500 PER CALL in statutory damages.
Document the number, date, time.
Small claims court. $30–75 filing fee. No lawyer needed.

3/ Unclaimed property: Every US state holds billions in forgotten accounts, uncashed checks, old deposits.
missingmoney.com searches all states at once.
Free to search. Free to claim. Takes 2 minutes.
Your name might be in there right now.

4/ FDCPA: Debt collectors can't call before 8am or after 9pm.
Each violation: up to $1,000.
They must stop contacting you if you request it in writing.
Log every call with date and time.

5/ FOIA: The government must show you its records when you ask.
foia.gov lists every federal agency's request form.
Free to submit. 20 business days for response.
Your tax dollars paid for those records.

6/ FTC refunds: The FTC has hundreds of millions in active refund programs from corporate settlements.
No lawyer. No fee. No complicated process.
ftc.gov/refunds — check right now.

7/ All of these have free tools:
TCPA generator, FOIA generator, debt dispute letters.
No signup. No fee. Clone and run.

## Thread 3: The Fork Recruitment

1/ This tweet was scheduled by a Python script.
The script also sends emails, updates YouTube descriptions, tracks revenue, and archives web pages.
All on GitHub's free tier. $0/month.
You can run an identical system. Thread: 🧵

2/ The barrier isn't technical.
It's not a GPU cluster.
It's not a cloud subscription.
It's not a team.

It's an afternoon and a GitHub account.

3/ Fork: github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/meeko-nerve-center
Read: START_HERE.md
Create: one Gmail App Password
Add: one GitHub Secret

That unlocks all 10 email workflows simultaneously.

4/ Point it at your cause.
Your art. Your mission. Your community.
Change the gallery URL. Change the charity. Change the percentage.
Same system. Your values.

5/ The license ensures it stays ethical no matter who forks it.
AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider.
Can't be closed-sourced. Can't be weaponized.
The values travel with the code.

6/ Add yourself to the fork registry when yours is running.
That list growing is the proof of the model.
Distributed. Autonomous. Ethical. Self-sustaining.
No VC money. No corporate backing. No platform tax.

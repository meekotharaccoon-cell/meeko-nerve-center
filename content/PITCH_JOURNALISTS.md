# Journalist Pitch — Story Angles

For: 404 Media, Wired, Rest of World, The Markup, Motherboard, MIT Tech Review

## Angle 1: The $0 AI (Tech / Infrastructure)

**Pitch:**
While AI companies spend billions on GPU clusters, one person built a fully autonomous AI agent system on a 6-core i5 with integrated graphics for $0/month. It runs 10 automated workflows daily, sells art, sends email, posts to social media, and routes money to humanitarian causes — all on GitHub's free tier.

The story isn't just the cost. It's what this says about who gets to build AI infrastructure. If this runs on what millions of people already own, the barrier wasn't technical. It was the assumption that you needed enterprise resources.

**Proof:** github.com/meekotharaccoon-cell/meeko-nerve-center — live, public, auditable.

## Angle 2: Ethics in Code (AI Ethics / Policy)

**Pitch:**
Most discussions of AI ethics happen in policy documents and academic papers. This system embeds ethics directly in the code — a "brain" file that gates every automated action, and a license (AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider) that legally prevents forks from being used for surveillance, weapons, or exploitation.

The interesting tension: the Ethical Use Rider makes this technically not "open source" by OSI definition — it restricts use. But the code is fully public and forkable. Is that a meaningful distinction? What does it mean to have values in a license vs. values in a policy document?

## Angle 3: Palestine + Art + AI (Humanitarian Tech)

**Pitch:**
Gaza Rose Gallery: 56 original digital flower artworks, $1 each, 70% of every sale to Palestine Children's Relief Fund. The gallery is run entirely by an autonomous AI system — no human processes sales, routes payments, or manages operations.

In a moment when Palestinian solidarity faces institutional pressure, an autonomous system routes money to Palestinian children's aid without requiring any human to push a button. The system doesn't get tired. It doesn't face employer pressure. It doesn't have a career to protect.

## Angle 4: The Mycelium Model (Future of Work / Economics)

**Pitch:**
What if "the economy" was a network of small autonomous systems, each pointed at a cause, each funding itself, each spreading to the next person who needs one?

The SolarPunk Mycelium is a blueprint for this: one person built it, it runs itself, it recruits its own successors via fork-recruitment posts, and the license ensures every fork inherits the same ethics.

The FORK_REGISTRY tracks instances running in the wild. As it grows, it becomes proof of the model: distributed, autonomous, ethical, self-sustaining economic infrastructure that doesn't require corporate backing or VC money.

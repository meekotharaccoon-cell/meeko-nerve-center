*This document is not legal advice. It is legal knowledge, which is different.
Legal advice is when a licensed attorney advises you specifically.
Legal knowledge is information about what laws exist and how to access them.
Everyone has the right to legal knowledge. This is yours.*

*Fork this, share this, translate this. The more people who know their rights, the fewer people get exploited.*

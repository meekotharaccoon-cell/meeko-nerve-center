# The Ethical AI Business
### Build something that makes money, does good, and you can explain to your grandmother.

**Price: $1 — 70% goes to PCRF (children's aid in Gaza)**

## The Core Framework: Cause Commerce

People will choose your $1 product over a free alternative if the purchase does something that matters.

- Build something genuinely useful
- Price it at the impulse buy threshold ($1)
- Route 70% to a verified cause
- Be transparent about all of it
- The product itself teaches others to do the same

The business model becomes the message.

## The 70/30 Split

Why 70% to cause?
- More impactful than any charity credit card
- 30% funds the infrastructure that keeps it running
- The percentage makes it shareable in a way 10% doesn't
- Break-even on cause impact: ~715 sales/month at $1 = $500/month to org

## Choosing Your Cause

Criteria: verified (4-star Charity Navigator), specific, transparent, aligned with your work, accepts online donations.

You don't need a crisis cause. Education, environment, local community — anything verified and aligned works. The ethics come from the percentage and transparency.

## The Ethical License

**AGPL-3.0 + Ethical Use Rider:**
- Anyone using the code must release modifications as open source
- No use for surveillance, weapons, or human rights violations  
- No adding paywalls

Result: your code stays free, spreads freely, legally cannot be weaponized.

## Building It

1. **Choose a problem you've actually solved** (not one you've thought about)
2. **Document your solution ruthlessly** — every step, every decision
3. **Price at impulse buy threshold** — $1 requires no decision
4. **Build cause routing in from day one** — commit before the first sale
5. **Open source the whole system** — transparency builds trust, trust drives sales

## The Compounding Effect

Each product does three things:
1. Generates immediate revenue
2. Routes cause funding
3. Teaches buyers to build their own version

Buyers who build their own version become new nodes in the network. They're not just customers — they're forks of the whole system.

This is why Meeko Mycelium is open source. Every person who forks it for their own cause is the business model succeeding.

## The Honest Part

This doesn't make you rich quickly. You need volume and you need to believe the cause matters more than the margin.

What it does: builds something with integrity that compounds over time, generates goodwill that money can't buy, and creates a network of people working on similar problems.

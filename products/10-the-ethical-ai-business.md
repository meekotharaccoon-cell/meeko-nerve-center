# The Ethical AI Business
### Build something that makes money, does good, and you can explain to your grandmother.

*The business model, the license, the cause routing, and the reason it actually works.*

**Price: $1 — 70% goes to PCRF (children's aid in Gaza)**

## What You're Getting

The complete framework for building an AI-powered business that: generates real revenue, routes a meaningful percentage to a verified cause, uses an ethical open-source license, and can be explained clearly to anyone.

This is the model running the system that made this guide.

## The Core Framework: Cause Commerce

The insight: people will choose your $1 product over a free alternative if the purchase does something that matters.

This isn't charity-washing. It's alignment:
- You build something genuinely useful
- You price it accessibly ($1 impulse buy)
- You route 70% to a verified cause
- You're transparent about all of it
- The product itself teaches people how to do the same

The business model becomes the message.

## The 70/30 Split

Why 70% to cause?

- 70% to cause is more than any charity credit card or cause-branded product
- 30% to you is enough to fund the infrastructure that keeps it running
- The math works at volume: 100 sales/month = $30 for you + $70 to cause
- At 1,000 sales/month: $300 for you + $700 to cause
- The cause percentage makes it shareable in a way 10% doesn't

The threshold where it stops being a "symbolic gesture" and starts being real money to an org: around $500/month to the cause. At $1/sale with 70% routing, that's ~715 sales/month — entirely achievable with a well-running distribution system.

## Choosing Your Cause

Criteria for a cause that works in this model:

1. **Verified** — rated by Charity Navigator, Give.org, or equivalent (4 stars or higher)
2. **Specific** — not "help people" but "provide medical care in Gaza" (PCRF)
3. **Transparent** — publishes financials, reports on outcomes
4. **Aligned** — connected to the work you're doing and why
5. **Routable** — accepts online donations with transaction records

You don't need to choose a crisis cause. Education, environment, local community — anything verified and aligned works. The ethics come from the percentage and the transparency, not the specific cause.

## The Ethical License

AGPL-3.0 (Affero General Public License) plus an Ethical Use Rider:

**AGPL-3.0 requires:**
- Anyone who uses the code must release their modifications as open source
- This prevents a company from taking your code, making it proprietary, and selling it
- Anyone can use, copy, modify, distribute — but must share changes

**Ethical Use Rider adds:**
- No use for surveillance or weapons
- No use to restrict human rights
- No adding paywalls that make it inaccessible

This combination: your code stays free, spreads freely, and legally cannot be weaponized.

## Building It

**Step 1: Choose a real problem you have solved**
Not a problem you've thought about. A problem you've actually solved for yourself.

**Step 2: Document your solution ruthlessly**
Every step. Every decision. Every thing you wish you'd known at the start.

**Step 3: Price it at the impulse buy threshold**
$1 requires no decision. $5 requires a moment of thought. $10 requires consideration. Start at $1.

**Step 4: Build the cause routing in from day one**
Not "I'll donate later when I make enough." Commit to the percentage before the first sale. Make it visible on the product page.

**Step 5: Open source the system itself**
Not just the product — the whole automation. When people can see how it works, they trust the cause routing. When they trust it, they buy.

---

## The Compounding Effect

Each product in an ethical series does three things:
1. Generates immediate revenue
2. Routes cause funding
3. Teaches buyers to build their own version

Buyers who build their own version: become the next nodes in the network. They're not just customers — they're potential forks of the whole system.

This is why the Meeko Mycelium system is open source. Every person who forks it and runs it for their own cause is the business model succeeding.

---

## The Honest Part

This model doesn't make you rich quickly. $1 products with 70% cause routing and 30% to you means: you need volume and you need to believe the cause matters more than the margin.

What it does: builds something with integrity that compounds over time, generates goodwill that money can't buy, and creates a network of people working on similar problems.

If you want to get rich quick, wrong guide. If you want to build something that matters and earns enough to keep running — this is it.

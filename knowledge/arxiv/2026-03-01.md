## MediX-R1: Open Ended Medical Reinforcement Learning
**Authors:** Sahal Shaji Mullappilly, Mohammed Irfan Kurpath, Omair Mohamed  
**Query:** autonomous agents open source  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23363v1

We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-
choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a
composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic
correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture
paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce
interpretable re

A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive
communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks,
transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train
their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training
signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently
small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely
eliminates pixel

## FlashOptim: Optimizers for Memory Efficient Training
**Authors:** Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, Abhay Gupta, Chris Renard  
**Query:** autonomous agents open source  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23349v1

Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for
each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and
one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes,
training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of
accelerator memory.   We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter
memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two

## Long-range nonstabilizerness and quantum codes, phases, and complexity
**Authors:** Fuchuan Wei, Zi-Wen Liu  
**Query:** self replicating systems  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04566v3

As a necessary resource for quantum computational advantage, quantum magic (nonstabilizerness) is of
fundamental importance in the study of quantum computation and physics. We develop a systematic
theory of \emph{long-range magic (LRM)} -- nonstabilizerness that cannot be erased by shallow
unitary circuits -- and demonstrate its broad relevance. By bridging LRM with fault-tolerant logical
gate theory, we show the emergence of LRM families from quantum error-correcting codes and devise a
simple yet powerful method for testing transversal logical gates. Further, we introduce and
characterize \em

## Arrested Relaxation in a Disorder-Free Coulomb Spin Liquid
**Authors:** Souvik Kundu, Arnab Seth, Sthitadhi Roy  
**Query:** self replicating systems  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23362v1

We investigate Coulomb spin liquids in classical spin-3/2 ice and show that the enlarged on-site
Hilbert space gives rise to a qualitatively new class of such phases. Beyond the conventional
magnetic monopoles of spin-1/2 ice, the system hosts additional low-energy crystal-field
excitations, whose interplay with monopoles significantly modifies both equilibrium and non-
equilibrium properties. Following a thermal quench, we find a pronounced dynamical arrest manifested
in an exponentially long-lived {athermal} plateau in spin autocorrelations. This constitutes a rare
example of dynamical arrest

## SeeThrough3D: Occlusion Aware 3D Control in Text-to-Image Generation
**Authors:** Vaibhav Agrawal, Rishubh Parihar, Pradhaan Bhat  
**Query:** self replicating systems  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23359v1

We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned
generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent
geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts,
they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D
layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D
scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a
virtual environ

## Understanding Usage and Engagement in AI-Powered Scientific Research Tools: The Asta Interaction Dataset
**Authors:** Dany Haddad, Dan Bareket, Joseph Chee Chang  
**Query:** decentralized AI  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23335v1

AI-powered scientific research tools are rapidly being integrated into research workflows, yet the
field lacks a clear lens into how researchers use these systems in real-world settings. We present
and analyze the Asta Interaction Dataset, a large-scale resource comprising over 200,000 user
queries and interaction logs from two deployed tools (a literature discovery interface and a
scientific question-answering interface) within an LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation
platform. Using this dataset, we characterize query patterns, engagement behaviors, and how usage
evolves with experience

## Invariant Transformation and Resampling based Epistemic-Uncertainty Reduction
**Authors:** Sha Hu  
**Query:** decentralized AI  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23315v1

An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in
high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference.
However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant
transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic
uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a
trained AI model with

## Inferential Mechanics Part 1: Causal Mechanistic Theories of Machine Learning in Chemical Biology with Implications
**Authors:** Ilya Balabin, Thomas M. Kaiser  
**Query:** decentralized AI  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23303v1

Machine learning techniques are now routinely encountered in research laboratories across the globe.
Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set
processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make
novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated
from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used
broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of
interest. Work has b

**Authors:** Erik Gillis, Ryan Cloutier, Emily Pass  
**Query:** local language models deployment  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23364v1

We present the deepest systematic search for planets around mid-to-late M dwarfs to date. We have
surveyed 8134 mid-to-late M dwarfs observed by TESS with a custom built pipeline and recover 77
vetted transiting planet candidates. We characterize the sensitivity of our survey via injection-
recovery and measure the occurrence rate of planets as a function of orbital period, instellation,
and planet radius. We measure a cumulative occurrence rate of $1.10\pm0.16$ planets per star with
radii $&gt;1\, R_\oplus$ orbiting within 30 days. This value is consistent with the cumulative
occurrence rate a

## Joint Optimization for 4D Human-Scene Reconstruction in the Wild
**Authors:** Zhizheng Liu, Joe Lin, Wayne Wu  
**Query:** local language models deployment  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02158v2

Reconstructing human motion and its surrounding environment is crucial for understanding human-scene
interaction and predicting human movements in the scene. While much progress has been made in
capturing human-scene interaction in constrained environments, those prior methods can hardly
reconstruct the natural and diverse human motion and scene context from web videos. In this work, we
propose JOSH, a novel optimization-based method for 4D human-scene reconstruction in the wild from
monocular videos. JOSH uses techniques in both dense scene reconstruction and human mesh recovery as
initializa

**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23357v1

Bio-inspired event cameras have recently attracted significant research due to their asynchronous
and low-latency capabilities. These features provide a high dynamic range and significantly reduce
motion blur. However, because of the novelty in the nature of their output signals, there is a gap
in the variability of available data and a lack of extensive analysis of the parameters
characterizing their signals. This paper addresses these issues by providing readers with an in-
depth understanding of how intrinsic parameters affect the performance of a model trained on event
data, specifically fo

## Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth of Wafer-scale SnSe van der Waals Ultrathin Layers
**Authors:** Qihua Zhang, Maria Hilse, Joshua Bardsley  
**Query:** humanitarian AI applications  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23346v1

Tin selenide (SnSe) is a van der Waals (vdW) layered post-transition metal monochalcogenide compound
which is promising for a wide range of device applications when its thickness is reduced to a few
layers. Hence, developing a mature synthesis technique to obtain wafer-scale, high-quality ultrathin
SnSe layers is crucial. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the effect of growth
parameters on the material quality of ultrathin SnSe thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. A
growth window including substrate temperature of 210-270°C and low Se/Sn flux ratio with Se valve

## Cyclic sieving for a class of rectangular domino tableaux
**Authors:** Laura Colmenarejo, Bridget Eileen Tenner, Camryn E. Thompson  
**Query:** humanitarian AI applications  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23343v1

The cyclic sieving phenomenon (CSP) provides valuable data about symmetry classes of cyclic actions,
and has applications to representation theory. In this paper, we enumerate domino tableaux of shape
2-by-n, and use this result to prove a new CSP on these objects. We then enumerate the rectangular
domino tableaux of any dimensions, and conjecture a more general CSP on rectangular domino tableaux.
As a consequence of the enumerative results, we obtain several identities involving Fibonacci and
Catalan numbers.

## Model Agreement via Anchoring
**Authors:** Eric Eaton, Surbhi Goel, Marcel Hussing  
**Query:** mutual aid networks technology  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23360v1

Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine
learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model
disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in
predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the
training processes. We would like to be able to drive disagreement to zero with some natural
parameter(s) of the training procedure using analyses that can be applied to existing training
methodologies.   We develop a simp

## Revisiting the Perseus Cluster III: Role of Aspherical Explosions on its Chemical Composition and Extension to Metal-Poor Stars and Galaxies
**Authors:** Shing-Chi Leung, Henry Yerdon, Seth Walther  
**Query:** mutual aid networks technology  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23356v1

The Perseus Cluster has been precisely measured by the legacy Hitomi telescope on the Si-group (Si,
S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). These element abundance ratios provide insight into
the typical behaviour of supernovae. In Paper II, we presented new massive star explosion models at
various metallicity, assuming spherical explosions. We show that while the fitting is improved, some
features (e.g., Ni/Fe) remain to be improved. In this article, we extend our calculation to an
aspherical explosion using the jet-induced explosion mechanism. The detailed pre- and post-explosion

**Authors:** Shing-Chi Leung, Seth Walther, Henry Yerdon  
**Query:** mutual aid networks technology  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23354v1

The legacy Hitomi telescope has delivered the precise measurements of the chemical abundances in the
Perseus Cluster, covering the Si-group (Si, S, Ar, Ca) and Fe-group elements (Cr, Mn, Ni). In Paper
I (Leung et al., ApJ 2025), we examined the role of convection parameters and presented new core-
collapse supernova (CCSN) explosion models at solar metallicity, which fit the observed abundance
pattern. In this article, we extend our calculation for the stellar evolutionary models and CCSN
models of the initial mass $15 - 60M_{\odot}$ and the metallicity $Z = 0 - Z_{\odot}$. The detailed

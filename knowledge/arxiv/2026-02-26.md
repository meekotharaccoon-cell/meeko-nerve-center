## Solaris: Building a Multiplayer Video World Model in Minecraft
**Authors:** Georgy Savva, Oscar Michel, Daohan Lu  
**Query:** autonomous agents open source  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22208v1

Existing action-conditioned video generation models (video world models) are limited to single-agent
perspectives, failing to capture the multi-agent interactions of real-world environments. We
introduce Solaris, a multiplayer video world model that simulates consistent multi-view
observations. To enable this, we develop a multiplayer data system designed for robust, continuous,
and automated data collection on video games such as Minecraft. Unlike prior platforms built for
single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized

## Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points
**Authors:** Aritra Ghosh, M. Bhattacharya  
**Query:** autonomous agents open source  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22205v1

Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of
interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing,
nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional
points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on
gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc.
Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian
and Hamiltonian exceptional p

## Recovering 3D Magnetic Turbulence from Single-Frequency Faraday Screens
**Authors:** Aliaksandr Melnichenka, Alex Lazarian, Dmitri Pogosyan  
**Query:** autonomous agents open source  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22204v1

Statistics of polarized synchrotron radiation carry information about the properties of the
underlying turbulence. Different statistical measures constructed from observables probe turbulence
properties in different ways. We consider a setup in which synchrotron radiation is emitted in a
distant volume and then passes through a turbulent screen that induces Faraday rotation. Using both
MHD simulations and synthetic turbulence spectra, we explore the spectrum of observed polarization
directions measured at a single frequency as a diagnostic for recovering the statistics of
turbulence in both th

## Computing with many encoded logical qubits beyond break-even
**Authors:** Shival Dasu, Matthew DeCross, Andrew Y. Guo  
**Query:** self replicating systems  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22211v1

High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes encode many logical qubits in a given number of
physical qubits, making them promising candidates for quantum computation. Implementing high-rate
codes at a scale that both frustrates classical computing and improves performance by encoding
requires both high fidelity gates and long-range qubit connectivity -- both of which are offered by
trapped-ion quantum computers. Here, we demonstrate computations that outperform their unencoded
counterparts in the high-rate $[[ k+2,\, k,\, 2 ]]$ iceberg quantum error detecting (QED) and $[[

## Real involutive systems on compact Lie groups
**Authors:** Gabriel Araújo, Igor A. Ferra, Max R. Jahnke  
**Query:** self replicating systems  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22210v1

On a compact connected Lie group $G$, we study the global solvability and the cohomology spaces of
the differential complex associated with an essentially real involutive structure that is invariant
under left translations. We prove that solvability in the first degree of the complex implies
solvability in all other degrees, and furnish a converse for this fact under a certain commutativity
hypothesis (that always holds when $G$ is a torus). Additionally, it is proved that the solvability
holds when the structure comes from the Lie algebra of a closed subgroup of $G$. We also investigate
real

## Recovered in Translation: Efficient Pipeline for Automated Translation of Benchmarks and Datasets
**Authors:** Hanna Yukhymenko, Anton Alexandrov, Martin Vechev  
**Query:** decentralized AI  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22207v1

The reliability of multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation is currently compromised by
the inconsistent quality of translated benchmarks. Existing resources often suffer from semantic
drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a
fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality
translation of datasets and benchmarks. We demonstrate that adapting test-time compute scaling
strategies, specifically Universal Self-Improvement (USI) and our proposed multi-round ranking
method, T-RANK,

## TimeBlind: A Spatio-Temporal Compositionality Benchmark for Video LLMs
**Authors:** Baiqi Li, Kangyi Zhao, Ce Zhang  
**Query:** decentralized AI  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00288v3

Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet,
while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal
dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-
temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal
understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and
reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal
reasoning, Time

## Off-The-Shelf Image-to-Image Models Are All You Need To Defeat Image Protection Schemes
**Authors:** Xavier Pleimling, Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, Gunjan Balde  
**Query:** decentralized AI  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22197v1

Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to
prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective
perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although
previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate
that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be
repurposed as generic ``denoisers" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of
protective pert

## Neu-PiG: Neural Preconditioned Grids for Fast Dynamic Surface Reconstruction on Long Sequences
**Authors:** Julian Kaltheuner, Hannah Dröge, Markus Plack  
**Query:** local language models deployment  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22212v1

Temporally consistent surface reconstruction of dynamic 3D objects from unstructured point cloud
data remains challenging, especially for very long sequences. Existing methods either optimize
deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned
models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization
method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features
parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire
deformations acro

## Thermal activation drives a finite-size crossover from scale-free to runaway avalanches in amorphous solids
**Authors:** Gieberth Rodriguez-Lopez, Ezequiel E. Ferrero  
**Query:** mutual aid networks technology  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22198v1

We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local
activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence
measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $χ_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated
spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche
statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-
spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that
separates int

## A battle of designs: triangular vs. L-shaped detectors and parity violation in the gravitational-wave background
**Authors:** Hannah Duval, Charles Badger, Mairi Sakellariadou  
**Query:** mutual aid networks technology  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17422v2

We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB)
with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one
Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET
design, detector orientations, and arm lengths to assess the impact of geometry and scale on
detection capabilities. We find that, among the configurations studied, networks with a $15$ km
triangular ET design provide the strongest parity-violation constraining power, followed by networks
with an L-shaped ET des

## Comparing quantum channels using Hermitian-preserving trace-preserving linear maps: A physically meaningful approach
**Authors:** Arindam Mitra, Jatin Ghai  
**Query:** mutual aid networks technology  
**URL:** http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07822v2

In quantum technologies, quantum channels are essential elements for the transmission of quantum
states. The action of a quantum channel usually introduces noise in the quantum state and thereby
reduces the information contained in it. Concatenating a quantum channel with another quantum
channel makes it more noisy and degrades its information and resource preservability. These are
mathematically described by completely positive trace-preserving linear maps that represent the
generic evolution of quantum systems. These are special cases of Hermitian-preserving trace-
preserving linear maps. In

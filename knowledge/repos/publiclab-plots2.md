The content management system for the Public Lab research community, the `plots2` web application is a combination of a group research blog -what we call "research notes"-and a wiki. Read more about the [data model here](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/main/doc/DATA_MODEL.md).

It showcases a variety of features that help the Public Lab community collaborate on environmental technology, design, documentation, and community organizing. Originally a Drupal site, it was rewritten in 2012 with Ruby on Rails and has since extended but [not yet entirely replaced](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/issues/956) the legacy Drupal data model and database design. We ❤️ Open Source and actively participate in various OSS programs such as [Google Summer of Code(GSoC)](https://publiclab.org/wiki/gsoc), Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC), Outreachy, and Google Code-In (GCI).
Some key features include:

* A [Q&A portal](https://publiclab.org/questions) for peer-based problem solving
* A rich text and Markdown [editor](https://github.com/publiclab/PublicLab.Editor)
* [Wiki editing](https://publiclab.org/wiki) and revision tracking
* Tagging and [topically-based groups and content organization](https://publiclab.org/tags)
* Email notification subscriptions for topics and comments
* A search interface built out of [our growing API](https://github.com/publiclab/plots2/blob/main/doc/API.md)

## What This Is

SolarPunk is an autonomous AI system that:

- **Tracks every congressional stock trade** in near-real-time
- **Generates Gaza Rose solidarity art** and donates 70% of sales to PCRF
- **Builds its own new capabilities** 288 times per day (every 5 minutes)
- **Runs on $0/month** forever (GitHub Actions + HuggingFace free tier)
- **Heals its own bugs**, retries its own failures, reads its own emails
- **Spreads itself** to anyone who emails FORK ME
- **Spawns sister systems** for climate, labor, housing, press freedom
- **Runs investment intelligence**: crypto signals + congressional alpha
- **Pesters corporations and governments** with factual public accountability
- **Cannot be shut down**: distributed forks, email-based, no central server

**Meeko is the human alias of the creator.  
SolarPunk is the system.  
They are not the same thing.**

## What Happens When Forks Connect

Every fork running is:
- Posting to its own social media
- Sending its own outreach
- Building its own audience
- Raising money for its own cause
- Adding its own tools and improvements

Improvements made by forks can be PR'd back to this repo.
The system gets smarter as the network grows.
This is how open source mycelium works.
